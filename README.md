# Machine-Learning-Notes

📘 Machine Learning Notes
Welcome to my Machine Learning Notes repository!
This repo is a structured collection of my personal notes, explanations, and code snippets — all created while learning and applying machine learning concepts.

🔍 What's Inside?
This repository covers:

✅ Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning basics.

📈 Regression Algorithms
Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, etc.

🌲 Classification Algorithms
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, etc.

🧠 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Theory and implementation with hyperparameter tuning.

🔄 Model Evaluation
Cross-validation, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values, encoding, scaling, feature engineering.

🛠️ Pipelines and GridSearch
Clean and modular model building using Scikit-learn Pipelines.

🧪 Projects & Case Studies (Coming soon)
Real-world problems using EDA, model building, and interpretation.
